  At the end of the day, most people have a pretty darn good camera right next
  to them in the pocket. So what's it take for a photographer in 2020 to have an
  edge over your iPhone? One major factor is optics.

![Choosing a prime lens](https://ucarecdn.com/5fbd58eb-b28b-4998-bfd9-f6276c1eed67/)

Optics really make all the difference. And using primes, you're able to bring in new levels of light before having to crank up your ISO or pulling out the tripod. Only thing is you'll be using your feet to compose your shots :)

The hardest thing most people have with under standing prime lenses is getting a grok on the numbering system. The way I think of it is that the 50mm is basically the equivalent to your natural eye. Anything less than 50 you can consider a wide angle lens, or wider than how you view the world naturally. Conversely, a lens with a focal length greater than 50mm will yield images appearing more zoomed in then the natural perspective.

That being said I would always recommend learning on a 50mm, such as the Canon "Nifty 50" or the Nikon/Sony equivalent. These lenses help you find your photographic roots in terms of understanding composition and moving to find the shot. Additionally it's an excellent lens for portraits (along with the 85mm or 135mm).
