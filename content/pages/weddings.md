subtitle: Exceeding expectations on your most important day
section1: >-
  ## From start to finish 

  With most of my photography, I lean towards a photojournalist perspective. I aim to document the entire day, capturing the essence of reliving that event. From preparation, to final dances, the story of a wedding is one couples will always remember. Hiring a professional to document your wedding allows you a concrete way to recall your event and all the great people you shared it with.

# #   When it comes to wedding photography I'd say my three biggest strengths are experience, staying calm, and composition. For experience, having photographed many dozen weddings I've gained a solid understanding for the timing of the event. Several key moments should must be captured
#  # one that involves everything from the preparation, to the final dances at the end of the night.

  - description: Pricing is ultimately worked out on a per job basic, so make sure to contact me directly for an accurate quote. However as a general reference rates start at $350/Hour and are factoring in to include post and pre production time.
    title: How much do you charge for Weddings?
  - description: Recently I switched over to a Sony Mirrorless system, and quite frankly am loving the new setup. As a previous Canon user, I'm still a huge fan of their L series lenses and build quality on the 5D lineup, but the new autofocus system available on the A9/A7 cameras in a true gamechanger. With almost 700 focus points, nearly every shot comes out sharp and crisp. Combining the Sony A7 Mk III with a Zeiss 50mm 1.4 for portraits and videography produces magical effects I can't wait to share
    title: What kind of gear do you use?
