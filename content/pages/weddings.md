subtitle: Exceeding expectations on your most important day
section1: >-
  ## From start to finish 

  As with most of my photography, I view wedding photography from a photojournalist perspective. I aim to tell a story of the day, one that involves everything from the preparation, to the final dances at the end of the night.

  - description: Pricing is ultimately worked out on a per job basic, so make sure to contact me directly for an accurate quote. However as a general reference rates start at $350/Hour and are factoring in to include post and pre production time.
    title: How much do you charge for Weddings?
  - description: Recently I switched over to a Sony Mirrorless system, and quite frankly am loving the new setup. As a previous Canon user, I'm still a huge fan of their L series lenses and build quality on the 5D lineup, but the new autofocus system available on the A9/A7 cameras in a true gamechanger. With almost 700 focus points, nearly every shot comes out sharp and crisp. Combining the Sony A7 Mk III with a Zeiss 50mm 1.4 for portraits and videography produces magical effects I can't wait to share
    title: What kind of gear do you use?
  - description: Second shooters are available on request for both photography and videography. Typically second/third shooter jobs are needed for videography/photography joint contracts, and jobs $2500 or higher.

  - description: Photos are delivered via weblink or via USB at additional extra charge. Web links are included in all photo packages, and clients have full access to the unrestricted Hi-Res JPEG outputs from their session. Once clients have their pictures they may print them at their convenience on any available printer. MPix is an online servie I personally recommend, whereas Costco is also an excellent in person option. Photo turnaround ultimately depends on the number of photos taken and availability, but is guarenteed within 30 days. For photobooth rentals, headshots photos are guarentted withing 1 week.
