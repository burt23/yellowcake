Did you know that 3D printing can produce high quality, low cost parts, built here in America? By partnering with [3DX Tech](https://3dxtech.com/), we are able to use the highest quality filaments, proudly made in America. Filaments range from the extremely versilate PETG, ASA for automotive and outdoor applications, and carbon fiber and other advanced material.

You can check out some of the 3D printed parts I've worked on at thingiverse.
