  ## Looking for a professional headshot? 

  I specialize in portrait photography, which is generally what people use for their professional headshot photographs. These shots are usually done with either a 50mm or 85mm prime lens (sometimes 135mm for a particularly "tight" look), and in my opinion are best done outdoors in natural lighting (although studio rentals are available too). Sessions typically last 15, 30, or 60 minutes depening on the number of photos needed, and number of desired locations (typically 2max).

    title: How much for a professional headshot?
  - description: Portrait photography and headshots are delivered to clients within one week. Expedited service requests are also available.
    title: What's you typical turnaround time on image processing?
  - description: I generally recommend scheduling appointments around either of the two 'magic hour' timeslots, in the morning or afternoon. Timing ultimately depends on which best reflects you in your best mood, which comes down to personal preference. That being said the 1 hr prior to sunrise and 1hr at and after sunset are perfect times to schedule headshot sessions.
    title: When is the best time to schedule a session?
  - description: Generally these photos focus on clarity, composition, and lighting. My goal is to make sure the subject is centered (generally I base everything off the rule of third or the golden ratio in post), well lit, and feature nice bokeh. I typically will shoot on a Zeiss 50mm F1.4 for all portrait sessions.
